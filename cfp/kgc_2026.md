### Title

Terminology structured into a directed acyclic graph

### Summary (maximum 1500 characters)

DefinIT is a terminology structured into a directed acyclic graph (DAG). The project aims to create a hierarchy of precise and unambiguous terminologies for knowledge fields and academic disciplines. DefinIT removes ambiguity and redundancy in how concepts are defined across domains.

Definitions have procedural representation aiming to explain behaviors. Each definition is general. It can be a word or a phrase that represent a broad category or concept rather than a specific instance or entity. For instance, car, list, human, country represent general terms. My car, your todo list, Albert Einstein, Poland are singular instances of these general terms or so called singular terms. DefinIT does not examine singular terms. In an analogy to object oriented programming, DefinIT examine definitions or classes, but not instances.

DefinIT can be also defined as a kind of a Knowledge Graph. DAG structure constrains the possible connections between definitions. Directed “is based on” relation is the only kind of connection between definitions. The most fundamental definitions (roots) form the foundation of the hierarchy and are independent of any other terms. They can be clearly described without usage of other definitions. Definition dependencies define the definition level. Over time, the DAG can be updated with more precise and better placed definitions. It is a kind of living, systematic creation of a terminology for a specific field.

### Target audience

#### Who is your talk intended for? Who will gain the most from attending?

The talk is intended for researchers, knowledge engineers, ontologists, and data scientists interested in knowledge representation, hierarchical classification, and semantic interoperability. It will also appeal to programmers seeking a deeper conceptual understanding of computer science through structured terminology.

### Learning objectives

#### List 3-5 takeaways you hope the audience will learn from your talk.

1. Apply first‑principles thinking to conceptual design.

Understand how decomposing complex domains into fundamental, dependency‑ordered definitions supports building concepts from the ground up, clarifying assumptions and exposing hidden logical structure.

2. Understand the concept of terminology structured as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).

Participants will learn how a DAG can organize definitions into a hierarchy that removes circular dependencies and conceptual redundancy, providing a scalable foundation for building precise terminological systems.

3. Discuss practical applications and educational use cases.

Engage in a discussion of how DefinIT can support learning new fields, deepening understanding of specific terms, structuring expert communication, improving LLM training data and prompts, and designing preparatory term maps for books and presentations.
